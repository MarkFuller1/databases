-- Assignment 4

-- 1. Find the first name and last name (as one field) and debut date of people whose
-- final game was at least 10,000 days after their debut. Order by the date difference

select concat(nameFirst,' ',nameLast) as Name, debut
from People
where abs(datediff(finalGame, debut)) >= 10000
order by abs(datediff(finalGame, debut));

--2. For each pitcher, find the number of career home runs allowed. Limit the number
-- of results to pitchers with at least 4000 innings pitched (12000 IPOuts). Order
-- the output by number of hr allowed (desc).

select playerID, sum(HR) as Allowed
from pitching
group by playerID
having sum(IPOuts) > 12000
order by Allowed;

-- 3. Find the playerid, average number of strikeouts and average number of walks
-- per year for the pitchers with playerid starting with 'gibs'

select playerID, avg(SO) as Average_Strike_Outs, avg(W) as Average_Walks, yearID as year
from Pitching
where playerID like 'gibs%'
group by playerid, yearID;

--4. Find the fewest plate appearances (ab+bb+sh+sf) in 1893, 1953 and 2013 for players
-- with more than 16 games played. Output the yearid and the number of PAs.

select min(ab+bb+sh+sf), playerId
from batting
where yearID in (1893, 1953, 2013) and G > 16
group by playerID;

-- 5. Find the population standard deviation of strikeouts for pitchers in 2018 with
-- at least 200 innings pitched (600 IPOuts).

select stddev(so) from pitching where IPOuts >= 600 AND yearID = 2018;

--The modern era of baseball starts in 1920. For pitchers, WHIP is the number of
-- walks + hits per inning pitched. Output the playerId and career WHIP for each
-- pitcher with at least 20 seasons. Order the output by WHIP.

select playerId, (sum(W) + sum(H)) / (sum(IPouts / 3)) as WHIP
from pitching
where yearID >= 1920
group by playerId
having count(*) > 20 order by WHIP;
